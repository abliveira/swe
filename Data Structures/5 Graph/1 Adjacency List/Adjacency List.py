"""
Adjacency List Representation of an Undirected Graph

Key Differences from C++/Java Versions:
- Python uses dictionaries (`dict`) for dynamic vertex management,
  making it easier to support sparse graphs and flexible vertex IDs.
- No need to predefine the number of verticesâ€”nodes are created on demand.
- List operations like removal are built-in and concise (`list.remove()`).
- Exception handling (e.g., `try-except`) replaces manual bounds checks.

Efficient for sparse graphs: O(1) add, O(n) remove, O(n + e) display.
