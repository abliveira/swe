/* 
    Linear search is a simple search algorithm. It sequentially checks each element
    in the list until a match is found or the end of the list is reached. This algorithm 
    works on unsorted lists but is generally less efficient compared to other search 
    algorithms like binary search.

    Time Complexity: 
        - Best O(1)
        - Worst O(n)

    Space Complexity:
        - O(1) (In-place)

    Pros:
        - Simple to implement.
        - Works on unsorted lists or arrays.
        - In-place algorithm (requires no extra space).

    Cons:
        - Inefficient for large datasets with O(n) time complexity.
        - Doesnâ€™t take advantage of the sorted structure of the data.
