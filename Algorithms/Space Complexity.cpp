/*

Space Complexity refers to the total amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. It consists of two parts: the memory needed to store the input data and any extra memory (referred to as auxiliary space) that the algorithm requires.

The space complexity of an algorithm is a function of the input size and is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), O(nlog‚Å°n) ,O(2^n), etc., where nnn represents the size of the input influencing memory usage.

Auxiliary Space is the extra or temporary memory used by the algorithm, excluding the input data itself. Therefore: 
    Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Space used for input

This means space complexity accounts for both the memory needed to store input and any additional space required by the algorithm for its internal operations (e.g., temporary arrays, recursion stack space).

In general, an efficient algorithm should minimize space complexity. However, reducing memory usage does not always mean the algorithm will execute faster, as some algorithms may trade time for space. The goal is to find the best balance between time and space efficiency.

    // We also have three additional integer variables (n, i, sum), each taking 4 bytes.
