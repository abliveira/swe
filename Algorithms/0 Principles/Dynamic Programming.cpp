/*
    Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve problems by 
    breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing their results 
    to avoid redundant computations.

    To solve DP problems, we first write a recursive solution in a way that there are overlapping subproblems in the recursion tree (the recursive function is called with same parameters multiple times)
    
    To make sure that a recursive value is computed only once (to improve time taken by algorithm), we store results of the recursive calls.

    The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization typically reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial. 

    There are two ways to store the results:
        1. Memoization (Top-Down): Recursive approach with results stored in a cache.
        2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up): Iterative approach that builds the solution from the ground up.

    Common Applications:
        - Fibonacci Sequence
        - Knapsack Problem
        - Diff Utility (Longest Common Subsequence)
        - Shortest Path Problems (e.g., Bellmanâ€“Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
        - Edit Distance
        - Matrix Chain Multiplication

    Pros:
        - Reduces time complexity significantly by avoiding redundant calculations.
        - Simplifies the design of algorithms for certain classes of problems.

    Cons:
        - Higher space complexity due to storage of subproblem results.
        - Requires understanding of problem structure to define subproblems effectively.
